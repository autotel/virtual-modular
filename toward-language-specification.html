general       ├────────────────── Function
              | ├──────────────── data. If the operation's output is midi, second nibble is mapped into a channel (while the voice specification is mapped to channel) *1
              | | ├────────────── If the operation's output is midi, this is mapped into a note / cc number
              | | | ├──────────── If the operation's output is midi, this is mapped into velocity / value
              | | | | ├────────── If the operation's output is midi, data from this point on is ignored.
presetKit     ├────────────────── x00: clock tick
              | | | | | |         x01: trigger one preset given by the data 2 number, until note off (NI.! all headers give this result) *3
              | | | | | |         x02: send note off from one preset given by the data 2 number *2
              | | | | | |         x04: trigger one preset given by the data 2 number, and hold that note on until the amount of clocks indicated in the data 3 (NI.!)
              | | | | | |         x70: request of stored data, it will trigger a data response
              | | | | | |         x71: data response
              | ├──────────────── (if header 01-04) Not used. ? Maybe in the future I use it for multi-page or 2d presetKits, or multivoice in single note presetkits
              | | | | | |         (if header 00) The tick base number
              | | | | | |         Perhaps the presetkit can be transparent in this, forwardin the channel of the original event if not defined
              | | | | | |         (if header 70-71) Contains a request number, this allows matching the message with a promise callback function
              | | ├────────────── (if header 01-04) Preset number to trigger
              | | | | | |         (if header 00) indicates the tick number
              | | | ├──────────── (if header 01-04) Preset velocity. Can be overriden
              | | | | ├────────── (if header 04) Lifespan of the note, in ticks. (the presetkit may have a different clock input)
              | | | | | ├──────── (if header 01-04) advanced sound parameters, if applicable
              | | | | | |
              Function header (NI.! currently shares byte with submode)
              │ submode/ voice specification (channel)
              │ | data 1 (note?)
              | | | data 2 (velocity?)
              | | | | data 3

sequencer     ├────────────────── x00: clock tick
              | | | | | |         x01: set the playhead to a position indicated by data 1, set the state to play (and play it?) (NI.!)
              | | | | | |         x02: set the state to stop (NI.!)
              | | | | | |         x03: jump playhead to position indicated by data 1, but don't change the playing state (NI.!)
              | | | | | |         x70: request of stored data, it will trigger a data response
              | | | | | |         x71: data response
              | ├──────────────── (if header 70-71) Contains a request number, this allows matching the message with a promise callback function
              | | | | | |         (if header 00) indicates the clocks per step of the clock. If 0, it defaults to 12. Sequencer may have a step divider on top*4
              | | ├────────────── (if header 01 or 04) indicates the step where to jump. If larger than sequence length, it %'s the number
              | | | | | |         (if header 00) indicates the tick number
              | | | ├────────────
              | | | | ├──────────
Harmonic map. ├────────────────── x00: clock tick
              | | | | | |         x01: send a note on with a harmonic mapping function, of the <data1>. *5
              | | | | | |         x02: stop all the noteons that could have been generated under the same <data1>
              | | | | | |         x03: change the current user-defined harmonic mapping function to the one indicated in <data1>
              | | | | | |         x04: trigger (...) &lt;data1&gt;, and hold (...) amount of clocks indicated in <data 3> (NI.!)
              | ├──────────────── this data is set to a fixed value, or transparent -forwarded as it came in- (allowing harmonic mapping of many different voices)
              | | | | | |         (if header 00) indicates the tick base number
              | | ├────────────── (if &lt;header&gt; is 01-02 or 04) indicates the note which will be harmonically remapped
              | | | | | |         (if &lt;header&gt; 00) indicates the tick number
              | | | ├──────────── fixed value or transparent
              | | | | ├────────── fixed value or transparent
router        | | | | | |  (routes incoming signals to different outputs according to <data0>)

```

## Reference symbols:

\*1 if an operator maps to midi and over this, it needs to have different operation channels, there would be a conflict: the source channel outputs will have no voice mapping on the output. This is why a mapper to midi is not the same as a event operator... Also, if the operator's output is an analog signal, the mapping of parameters should make sense in the sense of midi. If more parameters are needed, the slots 3+ can be used for this extra information.

\*2 if the preset of that note has been triggered once the noteoff is requested, it will send a noteoff of the event that was triggered and not necessarily of the current event. (the preset may have been modified between the noteon and the noteoff)
NI.! Indicates that this function has not been implemented yet

\*3 Note that if a clock is sending absolute step, and it happens to be connected to a presetkit, the presetkit will become a rudimentary sequencer.

\*4 the effective step per clock pulse will be the result of clock timebase * step division

\*5 If it is converting to midi, it also transforms the header into a noteon/ note off accordingly
